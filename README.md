# How to run an inlets exit-server on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

## Inlets

For anyone not familiar with inlets. It's a project from [Alex Ellis](https://twitter.com/alexellisuk), a CNCF
Ambassador and the Founder of OpenFaaS.

> Cloud Native Tunnel You can use inlets to connect HTTP and TCP services between networks securely. Through an encrypted websocket, inlets can penetrate firewalls, NAT, captive portals, and other restrictive networks lowering the barrier to entry.
>
>VPNs traditionally require up-front configuration like subnet assignment and ports to be opened in firewalls. A tunnel with inlets can provide an easy-to-use, low-maintenance alternative to VPNs and other site-to-site networking solutions.

## Oracles Cloud Infrastructure

Oracles Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is the nearly perfect place to start an inlets exit node. After you created an
account, you will not only get a whopping $300 (250â‚¬) in cloud credit, but also some selected resources for free.
Forever!

Oracle is calling
them [Always Free Resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm#resources)

So what do we from a compute point of view:

> Micro instances (AMD processor): All tenancies get two Always Free VM instances using the VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro shape, which has an AMD processor.

That is amazing as it is exactly what we need for an inlets exit node.

Unfortunately, [inlets](https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl) is not supporting OCI at the moment. So to still enjoy the
perks of OCI and inlets we're going to use Terraform to install the exit node. Classic...

## How-to

### Binaries

We're going completely vanilla to this. So only `terraform` and inlets `inletsctl` is needed.

```bash
# Install to local directory (and for Windows users)
curl -sLSf https://inletsctl.inlets.dev | sh

# Install directly to /usr/local/bin/
curl -sLSf https://inletsctl.inlets.dev | sudo sh

brew install terraform
```

We need the inlets-pro binaries to connect to the exit server

```bash
inletsctl download
2021/08/16 01:11:11 https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases/tag/0.8.9
Starting download of inlets-pro 0.8.9, this could take a few moments.
Download completed, make sure that /usr/local/bin is on your path.
  inlets-pro version
```

### OCI API Keys

After you created your OCI account, you can crate your API keys. These are special type of public keys used to perform
any kind of API operations. There are different ways to create this API keys.

To keep in simple, I prefer the UI way:

1. Open the Console, and sign in.
1. View the details for the user who will be calling the API with the key pair:
    - If you're signed in as the user:
    - Open the Profile menu (User menu icon) and click User Settings.
1. Click Add Public Key.

After this, you will be greeted with a dialog with all the relevant information you need for `terraform` to run.

Then rename the `terraform.tfvars.changme` in `terraform.tfvars` and fill out the infos from above

```terraform 
tenancy_ocid = xx
user_ocid = xx
private_key_path = xx
fingerprint = xx
region = xx
ssh_public_key = xx
```

### Terraform

Now, that you filled out the information, the `terraform` OCI provider needs, you can simply run your `terraform`
commands

```bash
terraform init

terraform plan

terrafrom apply
```

If everything works like `plan`ed, you should see following, similar output:

```bash
oci_core_instance.inlets-ubuntu-instance: Creation complete after 48s [id=ocid1.instance.oc1.eu-frankfurt-1.antheljtoboqxvycp3pui4xy5rva6nmna2siow2tgukeggpmatvl5nzeskpa]

Apply complete! Resources: 7 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

inlets-connection-string = <sensitive>
```

Type ` terraform output inlets-connection-string` to see the connection details

```bash
inlets-pro tcp client --url wss://158.101.189.144:8123 --token RFMLihTUZ2WQbHkRNPRsATAJDqjgvMx7XywjiwFqB7nUI3HOLOwF8LMw8Nsk79TG --upstream $UPSTREAM --ports $PORTS
```

Now you can expose every local application via the variables `$UPSTREAM` adn `$PORT`

```bash
inlets-pro tcp client --url wss://158.101.189.144:8123 --token RFMLihTUZ2WQbHkRNPRsATAJDqjgvMx7XywjiwFqB7nUI3HOLOwF8LMw8Nsk79TG --upstream $UPSTREAM --ports $PORTS

```

### Clean up

If you don't need the inlets tunnel anymore, just type:

`terraform destroy` to purge everything.
